# Uncomment code lines if doing this for the first time

# Explore structure of raw data ----

# First, let's see what's in the zip files

# This dataset has 5 files
# The one we want is "September 25-October 9, 2014 and February 10-March 6, 2015 - Teens/September 25-October 9, 2014 and February 10-March 6, 2015 - Teens - CSV.csv"

# archive(here("raw_data/September-25-October-9-2014-and-February-10-March-6-2015-Teens.zip"))

# This zip file also has 5 datasets
# The one we want is "March 7-April 10, 2018 - Teens and Tech Survey - CSV.csv"

# archive(here("raw_data/March-7-April-10-2018-Teens-and-Tech-Survey.zip"))

# Extract CSVs from zip files ----

# archive_extract(here("raw_data/September-25-October-9-2014-and-February-10-March-6-2015-Teens.zip"), dir = here("raw_data"), files = ("September 25-October 9, 2014 and February 10-March 6, 2015 - Teens/September 25-October 9, 2014 and February 10-March 6, 2015 - Teens - CSV.csv"))

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
