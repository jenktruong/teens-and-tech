# Summer Data Challenge 2023
From Dana Daskalova

## Intro

The datasets come from the Pew Research Center and their surveys on teens, social media, and technology. One dataset came from 2014-2015, while another came from 2018.

## Plan

### Tech Stack

- R (for data exploration and analysis)
- SQL (for data cleaning and transformation)
- Tableau (for data visualization)

### Steps

1. Data Exploration and finding key questions
2. Find patterns during data exploration
3. Clean data (by removing duplicates or dealing with missing values)
4. Conduct hypothesis testing
5. Use any outputs to upload to Tableau for data vizualation

### The final output:
Develop a comprehensive Tableau data dashboard that encapsulates your findings and the insights you derive.
